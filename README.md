Robot description:

Abstractâ€”The CoVID-19 pandemic has brought about a set of new problems where robotic applications can be useful. We propose a CoVID-19 disinfecting robot that can carry out the disinfection of communal areas of public transport as well as the confined environments of coaches. These kinds of robots are in use today by for example, St. Pancras train station in London and by the Mass Transit Railway in Hong Kong. The robot uses a chemical based approach for disinfection. It has a removable spinning brush for an end effector that can clean flat, circular, or angled surfaces. This paper is focusing on exploring the use of such an end effector for the above-mentioned purposes.
